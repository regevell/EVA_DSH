To obtain the sensible heat load of the building we will be using the previous code we built for the EVA-DMBEM project in the autumn sesmeter of 2021 which will give an output of the maximum building heat loss coefficient (W/K), $(UA)_{bhlc}$ which can then be used as an input for the HVAC model.\n",

    "## Adiabatic Mixing\n",
    "In some cases where mixing occurs the resulting mixing point can have a relative humidity greater than 100 % which is not physically possible as the water in the air will condense as soon as the air is over saturated. This therefore must be compensated for in the computational model by adding adiabatic mixing, where the latent heat of the air at the mixing point is transferred into sensible heat at a constant specific enthalpy value. This will move the mixing point from the oversaturated region to the saturation curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis code of the above model are the functions ModelRecAir and RecAirVAV from the file ad_hum.py. Since the model contains two mixing boxes, there are four possible cases each one with a different A-matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The mixingpoints after both the first and the second mixing boxes are below a relative humidity (RH) of 100 %\n",
    "        --> no adiabatic mixing has to be added.\n",
    "    2. The mixingpoint after the first mixing box is below 100 % RH but the mixingpoint after the second is above 100 % RH\n",
    "        --> adiabatic mixing has to be added to the second.\n",
    "    3. The mixingpoint after the first mixing box is above 100 % RH and the mixingpoint after the second is below 100 % RH\n",
    "        --> adiabatic mixing has to be added to the first.\n",
    "    4. The mixingpoints after both the first and the second mixing box are above 100 % RH.\n",

    "    \n",
    "To decide which of these submodels has to be used, the algorithm introduced in the file mix.py was used. This means, that first a solution vector x is calculated with the RecAirVAV_adTest function, which is equivalent to the RecAirVaVmama function, but does not producce a diagram and returns x. After that it is checked whether the mixingpoints are below the saturation curve by comparing the humidity ratio of the point to the humidity ratio at a 100 % RH at the same temperature. According to this the correct model is called."
